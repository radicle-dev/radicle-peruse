The result of this research should be a document that lays out our semantics and serve as reference for the implementation and documentation for the repo.\n\nSome initial thoughts:\n* We should think about what it means to diff against two `Directory` objects to start off with\n* Should we include `History` information?\n* How do git and pijul achieve this?\n* What algorithms and existing implementation can we use for file diff'ing?","metadata":{"github-id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MzM0MDg4MzQ=","github-url":"https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-surf/issues/27"},"timestamp":1575558341,"title":"Diff Semantics","type":1}]}
