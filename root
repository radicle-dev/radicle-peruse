Thus, the function will return an `Error` since it cannot find the `Commit` for the submodule in the repository.\n\nIn GitHub a submodule is rendered as a link to the submodule's URL. Would this be possible in surf?","metadata":{"github-id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NTAxMzgwMDI=","github-url":"https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle-surf/issues/54"},"timestamp":1579088838,"title":"View Submodule","type":1}]}
