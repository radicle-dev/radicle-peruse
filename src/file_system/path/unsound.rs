//! In Irish slang there exists the term "sound". One is a "sound" person if
//! they are nice and you can rely on them. This module is the anithesis of
//! being "sound", you might say it is "unsound".
//!
//! The aim of this module is to make testing easier. During test time, _we
//! know_ that a string is going to be non-empty because we are using the
//! literal `"sound_label"`. The same for knowing that the form
//! `"what/a/sound/bunch"` is a valid path.
//!
//! On the other hand, if we do not control the data coming in we should use the
//! more "sound" method of the [`std::convert::TryFrom`] instance for
//! [`crate::file_system::path::Label`] and [`crate::file_system::path::Path`]
//! to ensure we have valid data to use for further operations.
